#  NodeJS REPL ? (Read Eval Print Loop)
-> The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug JavaScript codes.

R -> READ -> Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.
E -> EVAL -> Takes and evaluates the data structure.
P -> PRINT -> Prints the result.
L -> LOOP -> Loops the above command until the user presses Ctrl-c twice.
